# Vietnamese Professors In Computer Science in the US

- **Goal**: for students interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer
  Science (CS) under the guidance of a Vietnamese professor. Here's a
  [book](https://github.com/dynaroars/phd-cs-us)
  that can help _demystify the PhD Admission process in the US_.

- **Inclusion Criteria**: Vietnamese; full-time faculty at a US university with a CS PhD program; tenure line
  (tenured/tenure-track); and can **solely advise Ph.D. students in CS**. Similar to the [inclusion
  criteria](https://csrankings.org/faq.html) at
  [CSRankings.org](https://csrankings.org).

  - **Note**: Name and university data are mostly from CSRankings.org, which already performs a preliminary eligibility check.

- To **modify** details, please create a [Github
  issue](https://github.com/dynaroars/phd-cs-us/issues).
